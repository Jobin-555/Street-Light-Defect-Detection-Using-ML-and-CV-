# Street-Light-Defect-Detection-Using-ML-and-CV-
The project aims to build a system that automatically identifies defective streetlights in urban and rural areas using lightweight machine learning and computer vision. By analyzing light intensity beneath each lamp from captured visuals, it detects dim, flickering, or non-functional lights and reports their locations for timely maintenance.
